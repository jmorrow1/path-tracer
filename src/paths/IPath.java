/**
 * 
 * A continuous sequence of points in 2D space.
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * Usage:<br>
 * To get a point on an IPath p, use p.trace(amt) or p.trace(pt, amt) where amt
 * is a floating point value between 0 and 1 and pt is a Point (a coordinate in 2D space).
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * p.trace(0) returns a Point at the beginning of the path.
 * p.trace(0.5) returns a Point in the middle of the path.
 * p.trace(1) returns the point at the end of the path.
 * And so on.
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * Alternatively, you can use p.trace(pt, amt) which, instead of returning a Point, stores
 * the result of the computation in the given pt. This method is more efficient because it
 * doesn't require a new Point to be allocated.
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * To display an IPath p, use p.display(pa) where pa is a PApplet.
